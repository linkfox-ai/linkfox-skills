# Zhihuiya Patent Family Explorer

This skill guides you on how to query patent family information via the Zhihuiya (PatSnap) platform, helping users discover Simple Family, INPADOC Family, and PatSnap Family members for given patents.

## 调用方式

- **API 端点**：`POST /zhihuiya/patentFamily`（完整参数/响应/错误码见 `references/api.md`）
- **Python 脚本**：`python scripts/zhihuiya_patent_family.py '<JSON 参数>' [--inline]`
- **成本约束**：本工具会消耗积分；同一会话同一参数组合默认只调用一次，脚本带 24h 本地缓存。失败/空结果不得自动换关键词、翻页或改邮编连续试探；需要继续检索时先向用户说明会产生额外消耗。

**输出策略（脚本默认行为）**：
- **始终**将完整响应写入 `<cwd>/linkfox/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<session>/data/linkfox-zhihuiya-patent-family-<timestamp>.json`（`<cwd>` 为脚本执行时的工作目录，在 Claude Code 里即当前项目目录；`<session>` 取自环境变量 `SESSION_ID`，按用户任务自动聚合；**禁止写入 /tmp**，当前目录不可写则报错）
- 响应体 ≤ 8 KB：落盘后把完整 JSON 打印到 stdout
- 响应体 > 8 KB：落盘后 stdout 只输出摘要（顶层字段、常见计数如 `total`/`costToken`、最大列表字段的长度 + 前 3 条样本）
- 加 `--inline` 强制全量打印到 stdout（同样落盘）

**读数据建议**：先看摘要判断是否足够；需要具体字段时优先用 `jq`或`ConvertFrom-Json` 从保存的 json 文件按需抽取，避免整份 JSON 进入上下文。

## Core Concepts

A **patent family** is a collection of patent documents that are related to each other by priority claims. Different family definitions capture different scopes of relatedness:

- **Simple Family**: Patents sharing exactly the same set of priority applications. These are typically direct equivalents filed in different countries.
- **INPADOC Family**: A broader grouping defined by the European Patent Office that links patents sharing at least one common priority, even indirectly.
- **PatSnap Family**: A proprietary family definition by PatSnap (Zhihuiya) that extends INPADOC logic with additional heuristics to capture continuations, divisionals, and other related filings.

Each patent in the response carries its own `simpleFamilyId`, `inpadocFamilyId`, and `patsnapFamilyId`, which serve as unique identifiers for the family group under each definition.

## Parameter Guide

You must supply at least one of the two lookup parameters. If both are provided, patent ID takes precedence.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| patentId | string | Conditionally | Patent ID(s). Separate multiple values with commas. Maximum 100 entries. |
| patentNumber | string | Conditionally | Publication / announcement number(s). Separate multiple values with commas. Maximum 100 entries. |

**Rules**:
1. At least one of `patentId` or `patentNumber` must be provided.
2. If both are provided, the API uses `patentId` and ignores `patentNumber`.
3. Multiple values are comma-separated (e.g., `"US10000001B2,EP3000001A1"`).
4. The upper limit is 100 patents per request.

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| total | integer | Number of patent records returned |
| data | array | List of patent family result objects |
| data[].patentId | string | The patent ID for this record |
| data[].pn | string | Publication / announcement number |
| data[].simpleFamilyId | integer | Unique identifier for the Simple Family group |
| data[].simpleFamily | array | List of Simple Family member patents |
| data[].inpadocFamilyId | integer | Unique identifier for the INPADOC Family group |
| data[].inpadocFamily | array | List of INPADOC Family member patents |
| data[].patsnapFamilyId | integer | Unique identifier for the PatSnap Family group |
| data[].patsnapFamily | array | List of PatSnap Family member patents |
| columns | array | Column definitions for rendering |
| costToken | integer | Tokens consumed by this request |
| type | string | Rendering style hint |

## Usage Examples

**1. Look up family members by publication number**
> "Find the patent family for US10000001B2"

Call with:
```json
{"patentNumber": "US10000001B2"}
```

**2. Look up families for multiple patents at once**
> "Show the INPADOC family for these patents: EP3000001A1, CN112345678A, JP2020123456A"

Call with:
```json
{"patentNumber": "EP3000001A1,CN112345678A,JP2020123456A"}
```

**3. Look up by patent ID**
> "Get the patent family for patent ID 5af83e12-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"

Call with:
```json
{"patentId": "5af83e12-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"}
```

**4. Compare family scopes**
> "I want to see how Simple Family vs. INPADOC Family differs for US20200012345A1"

Call with:
```json
{"patentNumber": "US20200012345A1"}
```
Then compare `simpleFamily` and `inpadocFamily` arrays in the response.

## Display Rules

1. **Present data clearly**: Show patent family results in well-structured tables. Group by family type (Simple, INPADOC, PatSnap) when the user asks for comparison.
2. **Summarize counts**: Always state how many family members were found under each family type so users can quickly gauge geographic spread.
3. **Highlight jurisdictions**: When listing family members, call out the countries/regions covered to help users understand the patent's geographic protection scope.
4. **Error handling**: When the API returns an error or empty results, explain the likely cause (invalid patent number format, patent not found in database, etc.) and suggest corrections.
5. **Batch result organization**: When querying multiple patents, organize results per patent so users can easily find each one.
6. **No subjective legal advice**: Present factual family data only. Do not provide legal opinions on patent scope, validity, or infringement.
## Important Limitations

- **Lookup only**: This tool retrieves family information for known patents. It cannot perform keyword-based patent searches or full-text queries.
- **Batch limit**: A maximum of 100 patent IDs or publication numbers per request.
- **Data source**: Family data comes from the Zhihuiya (PatSnap) database and may have a slight delay relative to the very latest patent office publications.
- **Family member detail**: The family member arrays contain summary objects. For full bibliographic data on a specific family member, a separate lookup may be required.

## User Expression & Scenario Quick Reference

**Applicable** -- Patent family and equivalents lookup:

| User Says | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| "Patent family for XX" | Direct family lookup |
| "What are the equivalents of this patent" | Simple family search |
| "Which countries is this patent filed in" | Geographic coverage via family |
| "INPADOC family members" | Broad family lookup |
| "Related patents / sibling patents" | Family exploration |
| "Compare simple vs extended family" | Multi-definition comparison |
| "Batch check families for these patents" | Bulk family lookup |

**Not applicable** -- Needs beyond patent family lookup:
- Full-text patent search by keywords or classification codes
- Patent valuation or litigation data
- Freedom-to-operate or infringement analysis
- Patent application filing or prosecution
